# React Lightbulb Toggle with Context API

This is a simple React app that demonstrates how to use React's Context API and useState to manage the state of a lightbulb. The lightbulb can be toggled on and off using a button, and the state is managed globally via the context.

## Features
- Toggle the lightbulb state (on/off).
- Use of `useState` to manage the bulb state.
- Use of `useContext` to share the bulb state across components.

## Installation
